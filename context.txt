Issue 1: Bacalhau Problem in Docker, v2.10.0

I am trying to run my RP with Docker. This always worked until v2.10.0 was released. I tried using the Docker-Compose method but that was hopeless, so I am trying to run my RP using the normal Docker method. It seems to almost be working except that the RP container keeps restarting and gives this error:

[DEBUG] GET http://localhost:1234/api/v1/agent/alive: retrying in 8s (1 left)
[ERR] GET http://localhost:1234/api/v1/agent/alive request failed: Get "http://localhost:1234/api/v1/agent/alive": dial tcp [::1]:1234: connect: connection refused
Error: Bacalhau is not currently available. Please ensure that Bacalhau is running, then try again. GET http://localhost:1234/api/v1/agent/alive giving up after 5 attempt(s): Get "http://localhost:1234/api/v1/agent/alive": dial tcp [::1]:1234: connect: connection refused

I do not know why Bacalhau is not available in this latest version of the RP container. In previous versions it used to work fine just by running the resource-provider container, producing PoWs on my GPU and gaining points each day. My setup, as before, is a fresh install of Ubuntu server, dedicated solely to Lilypad, with these:
- Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
- Nvidia driver v535.216.03 (server)
- Cuda v12.2
- Docker Engine (Community) v27.3.1
- NVIDIA Container Runtime Hook version 1.17.3 (nvidia-container-toolkit)

Support: I was having the same problem on my RP, try this it worked for me:
- stop bacalhau and lilypad-resource-provider
- stop ipfs node & close terminal window
- new terminal, start ipfs node (ipfs daemon)
- start bacalhau (give it a 5-10 seconds to start)
- start lilypad-resource-provider

User: I think you are using the Linux method. I need help with the Docker method.

Support: Was sharing this info to try to identify what's possibly happening on the docker RP with regards to the bacalhau error and ipfs node. How does the ipfs container look? Are there any errors in the logs? With docker-compose a separate ipfs container is setup. Since you used the normal docker method, is there an ipfs container setup?

User: I've only seen an IPFS and Bacalhau containers when trying out the new Docker-Compose method, but I couldn't get that method to work for me.

I am using the normal Docker method, which only produces a single container called 'resource-provider'. Up until this version it was sufficient, RP worked perfectly, I believe it had the other components within it somehow. My only other containers were Uptime Kuma and watchtower.

With docker-compose method I was able to pull all the layers and they seemed to start okay, but my RP still would not work and gave this error:
Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint ipfs (a853ee118aad8aaffe7a6a87f2cefdfc7dd5872d6b5f2a50eda999b5ab65bfcc): failed to bind port 127.0.0.1:8080/tcp: Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 127.0.0.1:8080: bind: address already in use

Resolution: Need to kill old ipfs that's already using the port. After reinstalling Ubuntu, got it working using the Linux method.

Issue 2: Use multiple GPUs

Question: I have more than one gpu on the machine I'm running lily pad on and I'm wondering how to use more than one GPU. Any tips are appreciated?

Support: You can definitely do it but suggest waiting for rewards to be right before setting multiple up. For docker you just make each container/instance point at a single gpu each.

Same for Linux by adding the line to the lilypad service file:
```
[Service]
Environment="LOG_TYPE=json"
Environment="LOG_LEVEL=debug"
Environment="HOME=/app/lilypad_$i"
Environment="OFFER_GPU=1"
Environment="CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0"
EnvironmentFile=/app/lilypad_$i/resource-provider-gpu.env
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/lilypad resource-provider
```

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES would be changed for each GPU/instance. You need a service file for each lilypad resource-provider you run. In the service file, they each have a different CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES value, a different private key and/or a rpc url.

Q: Is it possible to use same address for all miners?
A: Not currently.

Issue 3: WebSocket error fix

Description: After running the lilypad node for a certain period of time, the message from the title appears and the node stops working (no more POWs worked on).

Hardware Info: Ubuntu 22.04.5 Jammy Jellyfish

Error output:
```
websocket: failed to close network connection: close tcp 172.17.0.2:52932->145.40.118.135:443: use of closed network connection
[DEBUG] GET http://localhost:1234/api/v1/orchestrator/nodes

```

Workaround: Stop docker and start docker again. This is reported to be an issue with rate limiting because there's too much traffic. Private RPC usage may help but issue persists.

Note from support: We have a rate limiter on the solver, which limits by IP address and route. Too many attempts could lead to abnormal closure messages. Could also be general connectivity issues. Current limits are set at 50 requests over 10 seconds per route, which was thought to be a generous allowance. But could see there may be issues if an RP was running many nodes behind the same IP address.

Issue 4:

Note: Users should be aware that bacalhau may take time to become available and container restarts are normal during initialization.

Issue 6: IPFS Node Configuration Issues

Initial Error
User: Getting an ERROR in journalctl -u bacalhau.service -f - your programs version (15) is lower than your repos (16). Please update ipfs to a version that supports the existing repo, or run a migration in reverse.
Support: Try running:
bashCopysudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade ipfs
User: Unable to locate package
Support: Check version with ipfs --version. You can install IPFS manually:
bashCopywget https://dist.ipfs.tech/go-ipfs/v0.16.0/go-ipfs_v0.16.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf go-ipfs_v0.16.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd go-ipfs
sudo bash install.sh
Environment Configuration
Problem: Program version shows 15 while IPFS version returns 16 (REPO version 16)
Troubleshooting Steps:

Check IPFS_PATH:

bashCopyecho $IPFS_PATH

Make IPFS_PATH persistent:

bashCopyecho 'export IPFS_PATH=/app/data/ipfs' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

Check ownership:

bashCopyls -ld /app/data/ipfs
If not correct user: sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /app/data/ipfs

Troubleshooting Steps for Connection Issues

Stop services:

bashCopysudo systemctl stop bacalhau
sudo systemctl stop lilypad-resource-provider

Ensure IPFS daemon is running

Check for port conflicts on 5001
Verify IPFS version (should be 0.30)
Run IPFS daemon in separate terminal


Start services in order:

bashCopysudo systemctl start bacalhau
sudo systemctl start lilypad-resource-provider
Notes

Some connection failures may resolve after a few retries
IPFS daemon should be running before starting other services
Verify no port conflicts exist for 5001
Service configs should be updated to latest versions
When using Alchemy websocket, connection should show as working
If services fail initially, allow some time for retry attempts

Important: Run IPFS daemon in a separate terminal window from bacalhau and lilypad-resource-provider services.i

Gateway server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080
Daemon is ready
3. Port Usage Investigation

Check for port conflicts on 5001 and 8080
Command to check port usage: ss -lptn 'sport = :8080'
Note: RPC API and WebUI may share port 5001 (this is normal)

Common Solutions

Wait for Services to Initialize

Sometimes the service resolves itself after waiting
Initial connection attempts may fail but eventually succeed


System Restart

Full system restart can resolve persistent issues
Restart sequence:

Restart PC
Start IPFS daemon
Start Bacalhau service
Start resource provider




Port Conflict Resolution

Check for processes using required ports (5001, 8080)
Stop conflicting services if necessary
Ensure proper service shutdown before restart



Notes

Issue can sometimes resolve itself with patience
Both RPC API and WebUI can share port 5001
System restart has proven effective for multiple users
Important to check for port conflicts when experiencing connection issues
Service initialization order matters: IPFS → Bacalhau → Resource Provider

ssue 8: RP Error
User: What is this error about? Also, can a wallet address run to multiple nodes?
Support: "Nonce too low" generally implies that the nonce used for a transaction is outdated or incorrect, potentially due to a concurrency issue or repeated transaction attempt.
Important Notes:

Each wallet address can only be used for a single node
Ensure wallet has both ETH and LP tokens

Issue 18: Wait, didn’t Lilypad used to rely on determinism and optimistic reproducibility for verifiable compute?

Previously, Lilypad required deterministic jobs on the network and used optimistic reproducibility to randomly re-run jobs to ensure trust, however this method has been deprecated due to:

the limitation the determinism requirement placed on what jobs were available to run on the network

the inability to realistically be able to determine a “deterministic” job to be deterministic easily
